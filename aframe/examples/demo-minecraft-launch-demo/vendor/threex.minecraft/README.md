# A-Frame Support
You can include it in your a-frame too - [a-frame example](https://abrockmeier.github.io/threex.minecraft/a-frame/examples/aframe-minecraft.html)

You can download the components from [here](https://abrockmeier.github.io/threex.minecraft/a-frame/build/aframe-minecraft.js)

- improve a-frame support
  - add the player with it as an entity
    - https://aframe.io/docs/0.4.0/primitives/#register-a-primitive
